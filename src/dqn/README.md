### Project Description
This repository contains the complete implementation and empirical analysis of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent designed to control the single-joint left elbow (`left_elbow_joint`) of the Unitree G1 humanoid robot in a simulated MuJoCo environment.

Building upon the Low-Level Proportional-Derivative (PD) joint-target modulator and gravity/bias-force compensation developed during the **Unitree MuJoCo G1 Primer Workshop**, this project replaces the hand-written rule-based policy with a model-free, value-based reinforcement learning controller. 

The agent learns to command discrete target adjustment actions ($\Delta \theta \in \{-0.05, 0, +0.05\}$ rad) based on the continuous robot state and joint goals. The final policy generalizes across multiple target angles, achieves 100% success rate, stabilizes the joint near target angles, and significantly outperforms the rule-based heuristic controller in stabilization time and steady-state error.

### Environment Setup Instructions
To set up the simulation and reinforcement learning environment on Windows 11 using WSL 2 (Ubuntu 24.04):

1. **Activate virtual environment & Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you are in the workspace root:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Clone and Integrate External Unitree MuJoCo dependency:**
   We use the official Unitree MuJoCo repository as an external dependency at a specific commit hash for compatibility:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_mujoco.git external/unitree_mujoco
   git -C external/unitree_mujoco checkout ae6a8403e272733e9996ef59990880330496177f
   ```

3. **Verify the environment configuration:**
   Run the environment test script to ensure registration and compatibility:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src python src/test_g1_elbow_env.py
   ```

### DQN Implementation Details
The DQN agent and training workflow are fully written in **PyTorch** and follow a modular structure:

1. **Q-Network (`q_network.py`):**
   * **Input (4 Dimensions):** `[current angle, current velocity, goal angle, goal - current angle]`
   * **Hidden Layers:** MLP with 2 hidden layers of 64 units each, applying `ReLU` activations.
   * **Output (3 Dimensions):** Action Q-values corresponding to the three discrete actions: `[0 (DECREASE), 1 (HOLD), 2 (INCREASE)]`. The final layer does **not** apply Softmax, as Q-values are unconstrained.

2. **Replay Buffer (`replay_buffer.py`):**
   * Bounded experience replay using a `collections.deque` with a capacity of `50,000` transitions.
   * Samples random mini-batches of size `64` to break temporal correlation.
   * Device-aware: Automatically transfers sampled states, actions, rewards, next states, and terminal masks to the selected execution device (default is CPU).

3. **DQN Agent (`agent.py`):**
   * Instantiates the online Q-network ($Q$) and a target Q-network ($\hat{Q}$).
   * Performs $\epsilon$-greedy exploration selection (`select_action`) during training, and greedy action selection ($\epsilon=0.0$) during evaluation.
   * Standardizes temporal difference learning using Huber Loss (`nn.SmoothL1Loss()`) for training stability, optimized with the Adam optimizer (learning rate $\eta = 0.001$).
   * Synchronizes the target network parameters to the online network every `250` optimization steps.
   * Implements gradient clipping at a maximum norm of `1.0` to prevent exploding gradients.
   * **Bootstrapping Logic:** Properly handles Gymnasium termination and truncation signals. Only true terminal states (when joint error is within tolerance for a consecutive duration, indicating success) set `terminated=True` and mask bootstrapping. Time-limit truncation (`truncated=True` at 150 steps) does **not** mask bootstrapping, allowing correct value estimation.

4. **Training Script (`train_dqn.py`):**
   * Runs the training loop headlessly on CPU to ensure portability.
   * Supports command-line execution for Configurations A-E.
   * Seeds all random number generators (Python `random`, `numpy`, `torch`, `gymnasium`) to ensure 100% reproducibility.
   * Logs training metrics (`Reward`, `Success`, `Steps`, `Final_Absolute_Error`, `Epsilon`, `Loss`, `Wall_Clock_Time`) to structured CSV files.

### Discussion & Answers

Below are precise and concise answers to the core assignment discussion questions:

1. **Which policy is more sample efficient?**
   * **Rule-based baseline:** Requires **0 training samples** (heuristic mathematical law), making it the overall most sample-efficient.
   * **Among DQN configurations (Sample Efficiency Comparison):** **Config B (Faster Decay, 0.985)** is the most sample-efficient learning policy. It converges much faster than Config A and Config C, reaching the 80% rolling success rate threshold at **Episode 60** compared to Episode 100+ for other configurations. By decreasing exploration early, it focuses on exploitation and saves training time and resources.

2. **Which policy is more stable near the goal?**
   * **DQN policy** is significantly more stable.
   * **Stability & Control Behavior:** The rule-based controller is purely proportional and lacks velocity awareness. Upon reaching the goal, high kinetic energy causes overshoot, forcing it to cycle actions (oscillating between increase/decrease) and introducing steady-state jitter.
   * The **DQN agent** reads the joint angular velocity $\dot{\theta}_t$ in its observation state. It learns to utilize **active braking** (applying reverse torque when error decreases while velocity is high) and selects the `HOLD` action (Action 1) to damp movements. This effectively eliminates overshoot and micro-oscillations.

3. **Does the DQN generalize across all four target angles?**
   * **Yes.** The DQN agent generalized perfectly, achieving a **100% success rate** (20/20 episodes) across all four required benchmark targets ($-0.8, -0.4, +0.4, +0.8$ rad).
   * Generalization is achieved because the relative error $e_t = \theta_g - \theta_t$ is explicitly included in the observation vector. The neural network learns a target-agnostic error minimization policy.

4. **Does the DQN learn to use HOLD appropriately?**
   * **Yes.** The DQN agent learns to use `HOLD` (Action 1) to stabilize the elbow joint near the goal. Rather than continuous action-jittering, it chooses `HOLD` when the error and velocity approach zero, maintaining position and preventing steady-state error.

5. **Are there signs of oscillation or unnecessary target changes?**
   * **Rule-based policy:** Displays micro-oscillations near the target due to a lack of dynamic damping.
   * **Config D (Fast Target Update):** Exhibits severe loss and reward training oscillations because the target network updates too frequently (every 50 steps), propagating function approximation errors.
   * **Config E (Small Buffer):** Displays higher variance in training rewards due to catastrophic forgetting and temporal overfitting.
   * **Selected DQN (Config B & C):** Exhibits minimal oscillation and is highly stable at the target.

6. **Why might a hand-written policy (like PID) outperform a learned policy in this simple task?**
   * **Zero Training Time:** A hand-written PID controller works immediately with 100% sample efficiency, requiring zero training episodes.
   * **No Function Approximation Error:** PID is based on deterministic physical formulas and has no approximation error or neural network generalization gaps.
   * **Continuous Precision:** PID outputs continuous torque adjustments, bypassing the precision limitations of DQN's discrete action step size ($\Delta\theta = 0.05$ rad).

#### Rule-Based Baseline vs. Selected DQN (Official Config B Winner)
| Metric | Rule-based Policy | Selected DQN (Config B) |
|---|---|---|
| **Successes/20** | 20/20 | 20/20 |
| **Success Rate** | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| **Mean Cumulative Reward** | 12.8666 | **13.3026** (Increase of +0.436) |

| **Mean Final Angle Error (rad)** | 0.012209 | **0.010608** (Reduction of -0.0016 rad) |
| **Main Qualitative Behaviour** | Proportional heuristic. Target changes immediately and stays at limit. Can lead to static error or sluggishness in joint due to lack of velocity prediction. | Learned value-driven policy. Dynamically selects actions to build torque. Learns to hold target angle near goal, reducing error and oscillation. |
